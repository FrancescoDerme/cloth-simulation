- Make the window fork with F11
- Decouple physics from lag
- Add a reset buttom
- Add more interactivity: the possibility to add constraints / points at run-time, as well as the chance to pin points at run-time and the possibility to move the cloth by hand and eventually tear it apart
- Investigate how to make the physics simulation more realistic, starting from energy dissipation / fiction, then more advanced simulation techniques
- Bug / unphysical results when two constraints overlap (traingle collpase) -> probably the only way to deal with this is to prevent collisions
- Experiment with 3D?
- wind
- solid object to interact with the cloth
